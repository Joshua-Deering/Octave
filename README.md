# Wav Parser

Wav Parser is a console-based app that can do various processing on Wav files. Its main purpose is for me to to a deep dive into Discrete Fourier Transforms, and to get better at writing good, fast (ideally) rust code.

## What it can do:
* Discrete Fourier Transforms (obviously)
* Play Audio from Wav Files
* Perform Short-Time Fourier Transforms with different window functions (Hann window, Square window)
* Generate Spectrograms from wav files

## Planned Features:
* A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm
* Waveform generator
* Transient detection / visualizer
* Real-Time-Analyzer (RTA)
* Support for more Wav-type formats and possibly other formats (mp3, ALAC, AAC, etc.)
